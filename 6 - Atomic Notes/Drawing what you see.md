# Drawing what you see


Drawing what you see is often difficult because we have many mental models of things. For example people might think that a person’s eyes are in the top third of their head when they are actually in the middle typically. 

When drawing focus on the lines of the image without thinking about their context. For example if drawing a person don’t think about the lines as fingers or clothing or glasses, just think about the lines that are there.
